Django Admin Configuration for the Discovery App.

This module handles the admin interface configuration for the discovery app.
Currently, no models are registered as the discovery app does not define
any database models. The discovery functionality is implemented through
views and serializers that aggregate data from other apps.

When models are added to the discovery app in the future, they should be
registered here with appropriate ModelAdmin classes to enable management
through the Django admin interface.

Registered Models:
    None - This app currently has no models requiring admin registration.

# Register your models here.
# Note: No models are currently defined in the discovery app.
# This file serves as a placeholder for future admin registrations.
