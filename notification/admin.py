Django Admin Configuration for the Notification App.

This module handles the admin interface configuration for the notification app.
Currently, no models are registered as the notification app does not define
any database models. Notification functionality may be implemented through
external services or handled by other apps.

When notification-related models (e.g., NotificationTemplate, NotificationLog,
UserNotificationPreference) are added to this app, they should be registered
here with appropriate ModelAdmin classes for management through the Django
admin interface.

Registered Models:
    None - This app currently has no models requiring admin registration.

# Register your models here.
# Note: No models are currently defined in the notification app.
# This file serves as a placeholder for future admin registrations.
