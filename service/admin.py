Django Admin Configuration for the Service App.

This module handles the admin interface configuration for the service app.
Currently, no models are registered as the service app does not define
any database models. Service-related functionality may be implemented
through other apps or external integrations.

When service-related models (e.g., ServiceProvider, ServiceEndpoint,
ServiceConfiguration) are added to this app, they should be registered
here with appropriate ModelAdmin classes for management through the Django
admin interface.

Registered Models:
    None - This app currently has no models requiring admin registration.

# Register your models here.
# Note: No models are currently defined in the service app.
